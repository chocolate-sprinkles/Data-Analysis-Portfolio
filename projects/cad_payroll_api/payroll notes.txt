Pay Slips

Employers need to give each of their employees a written or electronic wage statement (pay stub) on every payday.

A wage statement needs to be separate from a pay cheque, so that the employee can keep it. It needs to include:

    The employer's name and address
    The hours worked by the employee
    The employee's wage rate (for example, an hourly wage, salary, flat or piece rate, commission, or other incentive basis)
    The hours worked by the employee at the overtime wage rate(s)
    Any money, allowance or other payment the employee is entitled to (for example, vacation or statutory holiday pay)
    The amount and purpose of each deduction from the employee's wages
    How the employee's wages were calculated (if they were paid anything other than an hourly wage or salary)
    The employee's gross and net wages
    Any amounts withdrawn from the employee's time bank and the remaining balance

If all the information on a wage statement is the same as the last pay period, then employers don’t need to provide a new one until that information changes.

Employers can provide electronic wage statements to their employees. If they do, they need to provide their employees with a way to confidentially access and make a paper copy of each wage statement through the workplace.

he required employer and employee identification information is as follows:

    Employer’s name
    Employee’s first and last name
    The title of the position
    Payment date
    The work period the payment corresponds to

Salary information

There is also important salary information that must be included on the pay stub:

    The number of hours paid at the normal rate
    The amount of overtime paid
    The amount of overtime replaced by time off with the applicable rate
    The type and amount of any bonuses, allowance, benefits or commissions paid
    The hourly rate
    Gross pay 
    Net pay
    The tips declared by the employee or provided by the employer (if applicable)

Deductions

Finally, the pay stub must include all relevant information about the employee’s pay deductions. Some deductions such as employer payroll taxes are mandatory for all employees. There may be others as well, depending on the industry and the company in question.

Here are the deductions (mandatory deductions for all employees are listed in bold):

    Quebec and federal income tax
    Contribution to the health services fund (HSF)
    Contribution to the Québec Pension Plan (QPP)
    Contribution to the Québec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP)
    Employment insurance (EI) premiums
    Contribution to the company’s pension plan
    Contribution to the company’s group insurance plan
    Union dues

    

Employers must provide a statement of earnings or pay stub on each pay day and when making payments of wage adjustments. They must also maintain payroll records required by the legislation.

The statement of earnings must be separate from the wage cheque. It must list:

    the name of the employee;
    the start and end dates of the period for which the payment is made;
    regular, overtime, and public holiday hours worked;
    the rate of pay;
    the amount paid for each of wages, overtime and public holiday pay and work on a public holiday, vacation pay, and pay instead of notice;
    the employment category of employment for which payment of wages is being made;
    the amount of total wages or earnings;
    an itemized list of any deductions made from wages;
    total earnings; and
    the actual amount of the payment being made.

Ideally, the statement of earnings should have the name and address of the employer.
